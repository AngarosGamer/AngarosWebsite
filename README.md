# AngarosWebsite
Angaros's website! Enjoy some help on my work!

Hosts the Salad CLI website files.

Code in the website is horrible, because it is based on work I had done while I had little to no knowledge in HTML or CSS, so please bear with me if you plan on editing anything.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this horrible website, thank you we greatly appreciate your help, please read the contributing guide to see information like colour palette!

# Thanks for using CLI and contributing!
