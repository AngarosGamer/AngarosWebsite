						<p>Slowly increase the memory clock graph by a few mhz at a time. 
                            <br>Keep in mind that this graph displays the true clock of your memory modules, so a 10mhz increase in Wattman is equivalent to a 40mbps increase in bandwidth on GDDR5 GPUs, and a 80mbps increase in bandwidth on GDDR6 GPUs.
                            <br> As such, it is recommended to increase the plot point by relatively small increments. 
                            <br>As you tune your memory, you will likely experience crashes or showing artifacts.
                            <br>If this occurs, restart your PC or reduce the overclocks respectively.</p>

                            <br>Increasing this voltage can increase your maximum stable clock speeds with some memory modules, however others may experience negative scaling and lose frequency.

                       <p>Once you are finished with your memory overclocks, the next step would be to locate and adjust the core clock. 
                        <br>You’ll notice 7 distinct power states each with their own clock speeds. 
                        <br>Disable the “Frequency %” option. Next, raise the frequency for all power states to that of Pstate 7. 
                        <br>Now, slowly drop the frequency of every power state by a few MHz at a time. 
                        <br>Generally speaking, decreasing in intervals of around 5% would be ideal. 
                        <br>Take very careful and constant note of hashrate while doing this. 
                        <br>Hashrate will fluctuate somewhat, but as soon as it is consistently lower than prior to adjusting your core clock, revert to the lowest clock speed you can run without that loss in hashrate.
                        <br>Finally, reduce the voltage for each of your power states until your GPU crashes, artifacts, or the miner crashes. 
                        <br>Once you’ve done this, you’re finished.</p>

                       <p>-Some GPUs have the option “fast timings” and others have the option to manually tune memory timings. 
                        <br>Fast timings option will increase hashrate, but it may decrease maximum stable clock. 
                        <br>As such, you’ll want to keep an eye on hashrate to ensure that the gains it supplies outweighs the lower memory clock you’ll likely need to use. 
                        <br>With manual setting timings, you can simply lower timings until the miner gets upset, your GPU crashes, etc. </p>
                        <p>-It is recommended that manual tuning is done one timing at a time, with long intervals in between to verify stability. 
                            <br>Long intervals being ideally >1 hour. 
                            <br>Memory tuning is complex, so to avoid getting too deep in the weeds, the basic process by which you'd do this is as simple as finding a timing, lower it a few ticks until you lose stability, rinse and repeat with a new timing.</p>
